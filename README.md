# Real time sensor visualization app

# Goal:
Develop a mobile application that captures and visualizes live data from device sensors (such as the accelerometer or gyroscope). The goal is to
create an engaging and informative experience where sensor data is displayed in real-time through dynamic graphs or animations. The app should
provide interactive controls to allow users to pause/resume data collection, adjust visualization parameters, and optionally capture snapshots of the
data stream
